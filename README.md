# 📐 Wireframing

## 🧭 Introduction

Wireframing is a foundational step in the UI/UX design process where designers create simplified visual representations of a digital interface. These wireframes act as the structural blueprint for websites and applications, outlining content layout, navigation paths, and functional elements before full design and development begin.

Wireframes help align teams, clarify ideas, and reduce miscommunication by making user flows and layout intentions visible early. They provide a cost-effective way to identify usability challenges before resources are spent on visual design or code.

## 🧱 Key Elements of Wireframing

Understanding the core components of a wireframe helps in creating intuitive and effective user interfaces. Below are the key elements typically included:

### 1. **Layout Structure**
Defines the visual hierarchy and spatial arrangement of UI components on a screen.

📌 *Example*: A two-column layout with a sidebar on the left and content on the right helps users focus on the main content while keeping navigation accessible.

---

### 2. **Navigation**
Outlines how users move through the application or website. This includes menus, sidebars, breadcrumbs, and links.

📌 *Example*: A top navigation bar with dropdowns for different sections ensures quick access and improves findability.

---

### 3. **Content Placement**
Specifies where text, images, videos, and other media will appear.

📌 *Example*: Placing headlines at the top followed by supporting text and call-to-action buttons guides users toward meaningful interactions.

---

### 4. **Functionality**
Represents interactive features such as buttons, forms, carousels, or modals, usually in simplified or symbolic form.

📌 *Example*: A login wireframe may include input fields, a "Remember Me" checkbox, and a disabled submit button to reflect form logic.
