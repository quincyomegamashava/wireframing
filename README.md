# 📐 Wireframing

## 🧭 Introduction

Wireframing is a fundamental step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating simplified visual representations, or "blueprints," of a digital product’s layout and structure. These sketches help designers, developers, and stakeholders align on how an application or website will function before any actual coding begins.

## 🎯 Why Wireframing Matters

Wireframes play a critical role in the product design lifecycle for several reasons:

- **Clarifies layout and structure**: Shows where elements like buttons, images, and content will appear.
- **Improves communication**: Serves as a visual reference for teams and stakeholders, reducing misunderstandings.
- **Supports usability testing**: Helps identify navigation and user flow issues early in the process.
- **Saves time and resources**: Solves problems in the design phase rather than during development.
- **Facilitates feedback**: Offers a concrete design starting point for client or user feedback.

## 🧱 Types of Wireframes

- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**: Quick, hand-drawn sketches or grayscale mockups that emphasize structure and flow.
- **High-Fidelity Wireframes**: Detailed, pixel-perfect layouts often created with tools like Figma, showing typography, spacing, and functionality.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Figma**: A powerful browser-based wireframing and prototyping tool used for collaboration and design precision.
- **GitHub**: For managing project versions and documenting the wireframing process.
